// Use Radix UI Tabs for better organization
import { Tabs, TabsContent, TabsList, TabsTrigger } from "@radix-ui/react-tabs";

<Tabs defaultValue="sections" className="w-full">
  <TabsList className="grid w-full grid-cols-3">
    <TabsTrigger value="sections">Sections</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="questions">Questions</TabsTrigger>
    <TabsTrigger value="overview">Overview</TabsTrigger>
  </TabsList>
  <TabsContent value="sections">
    {/* Section editing components */}
  </TabsContent>
  <TabsContent value="questions">
    {/* Question editing components */}
  </TabsContent>
