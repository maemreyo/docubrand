## Technical Architecture Decisions

### Key Dependencies
```json
{
  "next": "^15.3.4",
  "react": "^19",
  "typescript": "^5",
  "tailwindcss": "^3",
  "pdf-lib": "^1.17.1",
  "react-colorful": "^5.6.1"
}
```

### Critical Technical Challenges
1. **PDF Text Extraction Accuracy** - Using pdf-lib's text extraction capabilities
2. **Font Embedding** - Loading Google Fonts for pdf-lib usage
3. **Layout Preservation** - Maintaining document structure after branding
4. **Client-side Performance** - Processing large PDFs without blocking UI
5. **Cross-browser Compatibility** - Ensuring consistent PDF generation

### MVP Limitations (Sprint #1)
- **Single document type**: English quiz format only
- **Simple layouts**: Text-based content, no complex graphics
- **Basic branding**: Logo, color, font only
- **No user accounts**: localStorage-based brand kit only
- **No advanced features**: No templates, batch processing, or collaboration

## Notes
- MVP focuses on simple English quiz documents only
- No user authentication required
- Client-side processing for privacy
- Use localStorage for brand kit persistence
